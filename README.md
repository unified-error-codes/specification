The official repository for the Unified Error Codes (UEC) technical specification. A living, community-driven evolution of DIN DKE SPEC 99003.

## üéØ Current Focus

Our immediate goal is to prioritize and define the most critical error-handling use cases for the e-mobility industry.

* **Define the Use Case for ISO 15118-2 Authorization Loop Timeout - MVP of [uec-stack](https://github.com/unified-error-codes/uec-stack)**

  Our first priority is to create a detailed description and specification for this common and critical failure scenario.

* **Prioritize and Define Next Use Cases**

  Through community discussion, we will identify, describe, and prioritize the next most critical error-handling scenarios needed by the industry.
