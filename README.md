## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

1. **Git** — used to download and manage the project files.
   - **Windows:** Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run the installer.
   - **macOS:** Open Terminal and run: `xcode-select --install`
   - **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):** Open Terminal and run: `sudo apt install git`

2. **Docker** — used to build the specification without installing extra tools.
   - **Windows / macOS:** Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
   - **Linux:** Follow the [official install guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

3. **A GitHub account** — sign up for free at [github.com](https://github.com/join).

To verify everything is installed, open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and run:

```bash
git --version
docker --version
```

Both commands should print a version number.

## How to Get a Copy of the Project

### Step 1: Fork the repository

A "fork" is your own personal copy of the project on GitHub.

1. Go to the project page on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.
3. GitHub will create a copy under your account.

### Step 2: Clone your fork to your computer

"Cloning" downloads the project files to your machine so you can work on them.

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/unified-error-codes.git
```

> Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

Then navigate into the project folder in the terminal:

```bash
cd unified-error-codes
```

### Step 3: Add the original repository as "upstream"

This lets you keep your copy up to date with the latest changes from the main project.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/charinev/unified-error-codes.git
```

---

## How to Build the Specification Locally

The specification is built using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), so you don't need to install Python or Sphinx on your machine — just Docker.

### Step 1: Install Docker

- **Windows / macOS:** Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- **Linux:** Follow the [official install guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your distribution.

To verify Docker is installed, run:

```bash
docker --version
```
-**Windows / macOS:**  Make sure Docker Desktop is Open and you're logged in.

### Step 2: Build the PDF

From the project root folder, run:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/specification:/docs sphinxdoc/sphinx-latexpdf make latexpdf
```

> **On Windows (Command Prompt)**, replace `$(pwd)` with the full path:
> ```
> docker run --rm -v C:\path\to\unified-error-codes\specification:/docs sphinxdoc/sphinx-latexpdf make latexpdf
> ```

> **On Windows (Power Shell)**
> ```
> docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/docs" sphinxdoc/sphinx-latexpdf make latexpdf
> ```

This will download the Sphinx image (first time only) and build the specification as a PDF.

### Step 3: View the result

The generated PDF is located at:

```
specification/_build/latex/unifiederrorcodes.pdf
```

Open it with any PDF viewer.

---
### Step 4: Make Clean
If you want to clean the build first:
>```
>**On Windows (PowerShell)**
>docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/docs" sphinxdoc/sphinx-latexpdf make clean
>```
